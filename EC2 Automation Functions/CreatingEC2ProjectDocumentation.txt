*Apparently, the t2.micro instance is incompatiable with the current configuration.
There may have been some error on my end. I will attempt again tomorrow.

I am using windows so i have to figure out how to transfer my private key to my remote virtual machine.

A quick google search has introduced me to WinSCP 
USing winscp i was able to transfer the key pair file to my linux instance.

Another issue arose as i tried to use the chmod 400 command. 

The file was stated to not be found. I then figured that the terminal may not implicitly be able to access or alter a file without pointing to the proper directory.
I had transferred the file to my desktop.


chmod 400 /home/cloud_user/Desktop/LambdaEC2PairDiddy seemed to work.

I then tried

 ssh -i "LambdaEC2PairDiddy.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-92-79-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com
and this error was returned.
Warning: Identity file LambdaEC2PairDiddy.pem not accessible: No such file or directory.

That also seems sloppy, so I then used 

$ cd /home/cloud_user/Desktop
$ chmod 400 LambdaEC2PairDiddy
$ ssh -i "LambdaEC2PairDiddy" ec2-user@ec2-3-92-79-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com

I was then able to connect to the EC2 Instance, verifying that this project has been completed.
